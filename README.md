Listed below are the key hardware components of the mortcraft system:

## Connection to Backend
The mortcraft hardware system establishes a connection to the backend server to exchange data and information. This section outlines the protocols, endpoints, and any security measures in place for this communication.

Communication Protocol: Specify the protocol used for communication (e.g., HTTP, MQTT, etc.).
Endpoint(s): Provide the endpoints or URLs used to connect to the backend server.
Security Measures: Detail any encryption or authentication methods in place to secure the connection.
